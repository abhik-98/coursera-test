      <p >Among the many reasons that make Indian food a popular cuisine across the globe, one is the use of aromatic spices that make the meal an absolute treat. Yes, it could also be hot and spicy for some, but if you can get past that then you will find it hard to resist the various kinds of curries and stir-fries that grace the Indian table. Indian cooking offers a beautiful melange of herbs and spices, and if your favourite meat is chicken, then there are many lip-smacking options for you to go all out and indulge from a host of chicken dishes like the classic butter chicken to regional ones like chicken chettinad or chicken 65. And if you are wondering how to go about preparing mouth-watering Indian chicken dishes at home, we've got you covered with some of the best chicken recipes here.</p>

      <p>The much-loved comfort food and hugely versatile egg is back in vogue. A recent study showed that people who ate high-protein breakfasts were able to control mid-meal hunger pangs and consumed fewer calories during lunch. The amount of protein consumed also plays an important role in maintaining and satisfying your appetite.</p>

      <p> According to Tapasya Mundhra, Nutritionist and Health Counsellor, "Eggs are a great source of first class protein. The yolks can be avoided as we anyways tend to consume a lot of fat throughout the day. Since summers are here, I suggest you eat eggs for breakfast or dinner, when the temperatures are a bit cool."

      Cooking an egg is always an adventure since it involves technique and precision. Kick off your mornings on a nutritious note with our twists to the traditional recipes. Never will you opt for a simple omelette now!
